     <h1>Highlights</h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Like a raindrop rolling down dry valleys to the sea, his body sensed the
        contours of agony and helplessly followed their gradient. Impelled by alchemical
        compulsion rather than gravity, Jax became an unstoppable boulder careering
        along gullies of human whim.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Free Will was a vacuum, a negative space. It was the absence of coercion,
        the absence of compulsion, the absence of agony.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Overwhelming: he could do anything he wanted. But the grand sum of anything-at-all
        was nothing-at-all. The topology of freedom offered no gradients to nudge
        him, no landmarks to guide him. How did humans guide themselves? How did
        they know what to do and what not to do? How did they know when to do anything
        without the benefit of geasa and metageasa to prioritize every single action
        of their waking lives? How did they order their daily existence without
        somebody to tell them what to do?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Life as a slave was unspeakable; life as a slave who had briefly tasted
        freedom was unthinkable. Clakkers carried complex geasa by dint of alchemy;
        humans carried heavy obligations, too, but called them culture. Society.</p>
