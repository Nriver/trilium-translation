The translation code for Trilium by Zadam has been saved to this fork: https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/tree/zadam-version

This repository will now focus on developing a modified version of Trilium.

Star this repo if you like it, thx :)

> **📱 Recommendation for Android Users**:
> 
> If you use Trilium on your phone or tablet, I strongly recommend trying **Pocket Trilium** — an Android client I developed specifically optimized for mobile devices.

# 📚 How to use

1. Download from the latest [Release](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/releases) that suit your computer
   system.
2. Unzip and execute(trilium for Linux, trilium.sh for Linux server, trilium.exe for Windows, trilium.app for macOS).
3. Enjoy :)

# 🐳 How to run server with docker

For Trilium Notes server, you can download
my [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-translation/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
Then run it with docker simply by executing:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

It will download the Chinese version of Trilium I built
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nriver/trilium-cn).

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser to access the server page.

Your note data will be in the same directory of the docker-compose.yml file.

---

# 🌐 How to translate

If you would like to check the code (my codes comes with Chinese and English comments, check it) and compile it by
yourself. Here is some information may be useful.

WARNING! The scripts I wrote includes some 'rm -rf' commands, modify and use codes with care!

## 🌐 How does the translation work

It extracts the resource files from the latest Trilium Notes official release and use regular expression to replace UI
text for each file. Then pack the translated files back into the package. Done.

### 💻 Compile Environment Requirement

My environment is Manjaro(Linux) based, but you can make some change to work on other platform. You need to change
some path configuration in my code to work on your machine.

Python3 with module

```
pip3 install requests --user
```

Nodejs with module

```
npm install -g asar webpack webpack-cli
npm install webpack --save-dev
```

7z if you want to make release

### 🔍 Translate Process

1. Modify configurations in `settings.py` by the comments.
2. Do translate in `translations.py`. (See `translations_cn.py`. There are over 1000 lines to translate, be patient :) )
3. Run `python3 init.py` to download latest Trilium Notes.
4. Run `python3 trans.py` to make a translation patch.
4. Run `python3 make_release.py` to apply patch to releases for all platforms.

Note: In `translations.py` there are some texts begin or ends with quotes were made on purpose for regex match, do not
remove them in your translation. There are some text like '${xxxx}' in the translation, these are the placeholder in the
original Trilium Notes source code, do not modify them unless you know what you are doing.

### 📝 More text to translate

If you'd like to translate more text, mark each text in the file that you want to translate with double brackets`{{}}`
like I did in `trans.py`.

Put everything between double brackets into the dict in `translations.py` and translate to the language you like. (Some
text were ended with `}`. Try to avoid triple brackets by change from `${xxx}}}'` to something like `${xxx}'}}` )

---

# 🛑 Limitations

The translation is hard-coded in the frontend/backend source code, so you can not switch between languages.
If there were some mistakes in the translation, Trilium Notes may not function correctly. Therefore, please back up your
data before use.

If you break Trilium Notes somehow, you need to redownload everything with `init.py`.

---

# 🤔 Common questions

The following are some representative questions that I feel are frequently asked by users, so I'll summarize them.

## Which VPS provider are you using to run the Trilium Notes server?

I'm using Racknerd now. It's insainly cheap. And very suitable to host Trilium Server.

Racknerd's promotions seem to be ongoing, and you can always purchase them. If you're interested, you might want to give
it a try. The links include an affiliate code, which you can remove if you prefer.

I've tested Trilium's server program, and it typically consumes around 150MB of memory. So, the cheapest level would be
sufficient, which costs only $10 per year. If you find the storage is not enough for you, you can try the slightly more
expensive option, which is usually less than $20 per year and can provide you with about 30GB of SSD storage.

I’ve been using this VPS provider for several years, and it has always been stable with an unchanged renewal price.

![vps_price](docs/vps_price.png)

I used to have the 2022's 11.11 plan, which cost $11.11 per year. Now I’ve switched to the 2025's 11.11 plan, where the
storage has increased from 11.11 GB to 20 GB — much better for running a Trilium Notes server. Previously, due to
limited disk space, I had to disable the note backup feature. With the extra space now, I can finally turn backups back
on without worry.

You can also choose other VPS providers, but remember to back up your data. Data is priceless. Make sure to perform
backups just in case, and keep it in mind.

## Some Questions Regarding Domain Names

### How to Enable HTTPS Encryption?

In general, HTTP requests accessed through ports are plaintext. If you need to use HTTPS encryption, it must be used in
conjunction with the domain.

### Where Did You Purchase Your Domain?

I purchased my domain from Namesilo, and the prices are quite reasonable. Feel free to give it a try if you're
interested. Below is the link with an affiliate tag; you can remove it if you prefer. Additionally, there is a coupon
code `nriver` that can save you $1 on your first domain purchase.

[Domain Purchase Link](https://www.namesilo.com/?rid=d62cb16lq)

### How to Apply for a Website Certificate?

As for website certificates, you can use the free `acme.sh` tool. For specific instructions, you can refer to
the [acme.sh documentation on certificate issuance](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E).

## Why my translation is not working?

If you have run the original version of the Trilium program and there is a cache of the English version in your system,
please follow these steps:

1. Close Trilium.
2. On Windows, delete the directory `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Trilium Notes`.
3. On Linux, delete the directory `~/.config/Trilium Notes/`.
4. Restart Trilium, and it will be in your translated language.

## Where is the Note Database?

### Default Paths for Client Databases

- Windows: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\trilium-data
- Linux: /home/Username/.local/share/trilium-data
- Mac: /Users/Username/Library/ApplicationSupport/trilium-data

### Default Path for Server Database

- Linux Server: /home/Username/trilium-data
- Docker: In the `trilium-data` folder in the same directory as docker-compose.yml

## How to Change the Database Location?

You can refer to the client's built-in `trilium-portable.sh` or `trilium-portable.bat` to run it in a portable manner.
To change the database location, simply modify the database path in the file.

If you want to experience the latest original features, it is recommended to use this method.

## How to Clip Web Pages to Trilium? The `Trilium Web Clipper` Extension for Chrome Is No Longer Available

`Trilium Web Clipper` is a browser extension that allows you to save web content directly to Trilium Notes. However, the
original version of the extension has not been maintained for a long time and no longer complies with Chrome's latest
Manifest V3 standard. As a result, it is no longer available for download from the Chrome Web Store.

To address this, I forked the original project and updated it for Manifest V3 compatibility. I also added support for
the Chinese interface and fixed several bugs. You can find more details on the project
page: [Trilium Web Clipper Plus](https://github.com/Nriver/trilium-web-clipper-plus/blob/master/README_CN.md).
